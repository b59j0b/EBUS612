IMORTANT NOTICE: This is an individual assignment and your final report needs to be submitted via Turnitin. In your submission, YOU NEED TO STATE YOUR SAP SYSTEM ID FIRST! 
1.       Results from your three case studies                                                                                                                                                                                                    (50%) 
a.       Imaging   you are managing a   new material called   ABC-brake set. It only can be   produced   in house. This item will also be further used   for   direct   sales.   Please   identify   what   views   need   to   be   selected   when   you   create   its   material   master   data   in   SAP   and   also   specify   what   organizational   level(s)   should   be   associated   with   each   view    and   explain   your   reasons   respectively? (2 pages)    (10%)
b.       Drawing from your PP case study, critically reflect how   SAP   drives the   material requirements and production automation from demand management through various integration points. Clearly articulate the key benefits   SAP offers, supporting your analysis with evidence from your case study. Additionally, connect   your   discussion to   broader, credible resources to explore how these functions can support   real-world businesses across different scenarios. (5 pages)   (15%)
c.       Discuss the key differences between CO (Controlling)   and FI   (Financial   Accounting)   in   SAP. How are these two modules integrated within the system? Use appropriate evidence from your system to support your analysis. Additionally, if   you   intend to group multiple company codes under the same controlling area, what   conditions must   be met? (1.5 pages) (5%) 
d.       After completing your SD case study, refer to the   discussions   from the   MM   case   study   to identify all steps that impact the company’s   general   ledger.   Support your   analysis with relevant accounting documents and critically examine which   accounts   should be         credited and debited, providing clear   justifications for your reasoning. (4 pages) (20%)
2.       Extension after your three case studies  (50%) 
You have already allocated the cafeteria costs to the cost centers.   Now, you need to assess   the RD   expenses to the Assembly   and   Maintenance   cost   centers.   The   RD   costs   are   incurred   to   support   the   total   output   of   these   cost   centers.
To proceed, collect the accrued RD costs of 120,000 USD in a   suitable   new   cost   center (e.g., Res1###)   within   the N4000 hierarchy   area,   using   cost   element 6340000.   Then,   allocate these   costs   to   the receiving   cost   centers by   creating   appropriate   statistical key   figures.
Additionally, apart from the existing activity type (A###) output from the Assembly   cost   center,   an   additional   activity   type   (B###)   is   introduced,   contributing   a   total   of 1,000 hours. T代 写EBUS612 E-Business Enterprise System with SAP 2024 – 2025 Semester 2Java

Determine   the   new   total   activity   price   (unit   price)   for   all   activities   (M###, A###, and B###).   Provide   a   screenshot   of the   costing   report   for   your   Assembly   cost   center   and   briefly discuss   the line items originating from   the   new cost assessment. (2pages)   (10%);
b.       Manually   calculate   the   overall   cost   assessment   process   with   appropriate   explanations   and flowcharts. (3 pages)      (15%)
c.       Suppose   your   Maintenance   cost   center   (MAIN###)   now   generates   an   additional 700 hours of   repair output (R###, the associated   allocation cost element is 803###4), where 50 hours are used by Res1### and 100 hours by ASSY###. Provide   an updated costing   report for the Assembly cost center and discuss the key changes.   (2 pages)   (10%) After completing the Product Costing case   study,   you   decide   to   enhance   product   quality   by   adding two additional Chains and Brake kits to    your       final    product DXTR4###.   Additionally,      some    production      activities    have      been      relocated      to       a    new      work       center   (WK1###),   specifically   for   the   first   and   fifth   production   operations.   The first operation includes 5 minutes of Setup and 15 minutes of Labor.   The fifth operation includes   an   additional 3 minutes of Setup and 5 minutes of Labor.
d.       Demonstrate   the   screenshot   of your   new   product   cost   estimate   with   itemized   view   and   develop   a discussion   about this new report   (e.g. How   is   this   report   structured?   What   are the      main      changes      and      what      are      the      root      causes      of   those      changes?      Etc.).    You      use   information   (hint:   activity   price   in   CO)   from   your   system   to   support   your   analysis   (4 pages)                            (15%)
